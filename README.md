# **Sidenote**

  1. Currently this bot is only for private use only. I'm too lazy to make it public capable. 
  2. Rejoin voice channel after every bot restart.
  3. Can't handle multiple servers. One server only. Restart the bot if you want to use it on a different server.
  4. Very unstable I might add should it be used by anyone else other than me.

  No outside use without my permission.
