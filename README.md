# dark-v2
A remake of the original Darkgloow bot code

Discord music bot powered by discord.py and lavalink

Sidenote

  Currently this bot is only for private use only. I'm too lazy to make it public capable. 

  1. Can't handle multiple servers. One server only. Restart the bot if you want to use it on a different server.
  2. Very unstable should it be used by anyone else other than me.


  No outside use without my permission.
